    <section>
      <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>{{ org_name }}</strong> ("we", "us") handles information when you use <strong>{{ app_name }}</strong> (the "App"). The App connects to your GitHub account via OAuth to access repository data you explicitly authorize.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What we access</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>GitHub account details necessary for OAuth and scopes you approve (e.g., <code>public_repo</code>, <code>repo</code>, <code>workflow</code>, <code>read:org</code>).</li>
        <li>Repository metadata, commits, pull requests, workflow runs, artifacts, and file contents only as needed to fulfill your requests in the App.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How we use the data</h2>
      <p>We use GitHub data solely to perform the actions you ask for in the App (for example, listing commits or reading a file) and to improve reliability and security of the service. We do not sell your data or use it for advertising.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Token handling</h2>
      <p>The App does not operate its own token store. OAuth tokens are handled by the action platform that powers the App (OpenAI GPT Actions). We do not persist your GitHub access tokens on our servers. Tokens are used only to make API calls you initiate.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Retention</h2>
      <p>We do not maintain a separate database of your GitHub data. Information may appear in your chat history or logs associated with the App platform and be retained per that platform’s settings. You may revoke the App’s GitHub access at any time (see below).</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sharing</h2>
      <p>We do not share your GitHub data with third parties beyond the platforms required to provide the App (e.g., GitHub and OpenAI). We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and users.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>All API requests use HTTPS. We recommend granting only the minimum scopes needed and limiting access to specific repositories where possible.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Your choices and rights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Revoke access:</strong> In GitHub, go to <em>Settings → Applications → Authorized OAuth Apps</em> and revoke the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete chat content:</strong> Manage or delete conversations within the platform hosting the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Data requests:</strong> Contact us at <a href="mailto:{{ contact_email }}">{{ contact_email }}</a> for questions about this policy.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>International users & legal bases</h2>
      <p>If you are in the EEA/UK, our legal bases for processing may include performance of a contract (to provide the App), legitimate interests (to secure and improve the App), and consent (where applicable). You may have rights to access, correct, or delete personal data, or object to processing. Contact us to exercise these rights.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is not directed to children under 13 (or the equivalent age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy. Material changes will be noted by updating the <em>Last updated</em> date above. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
