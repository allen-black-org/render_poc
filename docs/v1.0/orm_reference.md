## ðŸ”— Relationship Notes

- All relationships are one-way for now (no `back_populates`)
- Class names are referenced as strings inside `relationship()` to allow flexible ordering
- All foreign keys are schema-qualified
- Column data types are aligned to schema (e.g., `Integer`, `Numeric`, `Boolean`, `Text`)

---

## ðŸ§  ORM Usage Tips

- Use `session.query(...)` with `.join()` to combine tables
- Filter using class properties, not raw column strings:
  ```python
  session.query(FactRevenue).filter(FactRevenue.is_estimate == False)
  ```
- Relationships allow attribute access like:
  ```python
  flow.product.product_name
  advisor.firm.firm_type.firm_type_name
  ```
